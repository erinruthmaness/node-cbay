# Welcome to cBay!

CBay is a simple online shopping interface that links a MySQL database of products (cbay_db) with a node app interface.  This application uses the mysql and inquirer npms.

[See a demo here](demo.gif)

The cBay app will read the information currently stored in the cbay_db SQL database and provide that information to the user, the provide them with the option to "purchase" as much of any product as they would like.  They will also be given the option to make additional purchases if they would like, each of which will update the SQL database on the back end.
